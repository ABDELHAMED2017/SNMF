# SNMF
C code for our sBSUM algorithm (parallel version), to reproduce our works on SNMF research.

Simply configure and run our code, you will get the result for parallel sBSUM algorithm shown in section 5, fig. 5. To get results for other figures, slightly modification may apply.

To run our code, MPI need to be installed first. 

Our C codes need following data, which need to be generated first.

problem dimension - 'dim.txt', ex. 16242	 10

problem matrix - 'dataM%d.txt', ex. y separate 16242 * (16242/y) matrix, where y denotes the number of processors we use.

initial value - 'dataX.txt', ex. a random generated 16242 * 10 matrix
